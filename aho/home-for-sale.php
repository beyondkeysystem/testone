<b>Sustainable Success in Real Estate Business. A Mirage or For Real?</b><br>
As compared to nearly five decades ago, the real estate ecosystem in the US has undergone a massive transformation. Not only has the size, scale and scope evolved, but also the way people connect together and generate leads for real estate agents, too has enhanced tremendously. What was essentially a local business with a few vacant homes or office spaces for rent or purchase, has now spawned to a multi-city, multi-agent business. Some key drivers like technological evolution and better access to data have changed the face of real estate in North America. For those who want to succeed in receiving realtor leads resullting in a rent or purchase transactions, can do well to take cognizance of these current success drivers so that business success within real estate doesn’t remain a mirage.<br>
<b>What works well today for real estate? </b><br>
Entrepreneurs in the real estate business today know that simply putting up a ‘Homes for rent’ or ‘Home for sale’ sign outside their office will not work. They have to take advantage of the dynamic environment and use it to their benefit and gather more realtor leads, better customer servicing and higher sales closures. <br>
Let us look at some historical context that has led to a host of opportunities coming up in the real estate segment. We can then move on to see how we can capitalize on these opportunities.<br>
<b>A historical context</b><br>
Much of the opportunities and action happening in the real estate scene in North America today have a lot to be thankful to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 1974. As per this act, every employer needs to deduct a fixed portion of every employee ever month and keep it aside for institutional investment. In addition to these, the spread and penetration of 401k’s and Sovereign Wealth Funds has now resulted in a substantial capital pool. This pool relies heavily on real estate as one of the industries to invest in. <br>
So while the opportunity is there, the rise of a few significant success drivers too has resulted in the good growth of real estate business in North America in today’s times. An entrepreneur dealing in real estate leads will not have had these opportunities in 1970’s or 1980’s that today’s realtors have.<br>
<b>What drives the accomplishment of the opportunities in real estate?</b><br>
In order to gain maximum from this massive opportunity, players in the real estate segment need to have a strong hold on these success drivers – <br>
<b>1. Internet – </b> One of the key parameters responsible for the success of the real estate entrepreneurs is a thriving technology in the form of Internet and smartphones. For example, it is now possible for a real estate agent in San Francisco to know what type, budget, locality or quantity of luxury homes are up for sale in New Jersey.  If a North Carolina resident needs to relocate to Washington he/ she can connect with a Washington realtor by responding to ads put up on the Internet for condos for sale or condos for rent in the DC area. The online discoverability of buyers to sellers and vice-versa through SEO, content marketing and social media is a key reason why real estate is no longer limited to local business.<br>
Reliable companies like American Homes Online have taken the power of the internet to a second level with their innovative offerings that brings together buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants on a common platform i.e. the Internet. <br>
<b>2. Access to Data –</B> The access to data on Internet has allowed real estate entrepreneur to spot opportunities that could’ve earlier been missed. If a person has put up a luxury home for sale in West Virginia, he/ she need not limit his/ her prospects to the neighboring counties. A realtor from Texas would be able to satisfactorily and successfully meet this need through his/ her network of contacts.<br>
Be it high rise condos or apartments for sale or even commercial properties for sale or rent, knowing these key differentiators will augur well for a real estate business. Do let us know if you have implemented any of these positive factors in your real estate business to gain vital business and prosper.
